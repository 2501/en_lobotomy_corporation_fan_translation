# Why have this file?
In short, because there are plenty of terms, names, and other details which reach well beyond one anomaly's file. Accordingly, we should build guidelines here to ensure we all stay on the same page and avoid introducing inconsistencies.

Below are listed standing guidelines, and below that, items up for consideration and discussion. Keep in mind that if a guideline changes, work to bring everything else into compliance with that guideline should take priority.

Discussion should be held in new Issues opened for the repository, and ideally focus on small pieces at a time so we can reach decisions and changes relatively quickly.

# Standing guidelines
NOTE: If something is missing from this list, _assume it is to stay as-is_ for now. It's more likely than not that we'll miss something at some point, so this way we don't prematurely shoot ourselves in the foot.

* Sephirah vs. Sephirahs
    * "Sephirah" should be used as both the singular and plural forms of the word, so use "Sephirah" over "Sephirahs" (or similar).

# Cross-file details to consider

* Work types, Stat names, etc.
* Classification levels: Zayin/Teth/He/Waw/Aleph
* Facility levels: Briah, etc.
* Various in-setting proper nouns. Recognized (example) list below:
    * "Sephirah", Manager (would Administrator work better?), Sephirah names, etc.
* ...
