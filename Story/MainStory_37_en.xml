  <text id="day37_angela_1">I'm still calling you A.</text>
  <text id="day37_angela_2">But I think you and A might have become separate entities.</text>
  <text id="day37_angela_3">From the moment you started having new memories, you both began walking different paths.</text>
  <text id="day37_angela_4">I wonder how the memories separated you.</text>
  <text id="day37_angela_5">Well, even if you two have differences, it is still important for you to watch this place through A’s eyes.</text>
  <text id="day37_angela_6">Why do we repeat this eternal cycle, enduring endless suffering?</text>

  <text id="day37_angela_12">Plus, I have seen many other Xs and witnessed their efforts and failure.</text>
  <text id="day37_angela_13">And you stepped on it all and climbed up.</text>
  <text id="day37_angela_14">Of course, I have kept all their data in my head, but it is not my place to mention it.</text>
  <text id="day37_angela_15">"A machine has its own work to do."</text>
  <text id="day37_angela_16">...Is what you or A once said to me.</text>
