  <text id="day38_angela_1">Thankfully, you've been collecting energy ever since your very first day here, never missing a single day.</text>
  <text id="day38_angela_2">My role is to encourage you to collect the proper amount of energy each day by using the carrot and stick method.</text>
  <text id="day38_angela_3">It must have been hard to adapt to the corporation, but you tried your best to extract the energy.</text>
  <text id="day38_angela_4">Along with bearing the numerous sacrifices along the way.</text>
  <text id="day38_angela_5">It was also my role to advise you, to help free you from the guilt.</text>
  <text id="day38_angela_6">This part was particularly irritating because it wasn't in my programming, but I still was able to fulfill my role.</text>
  <text id="day38_angela_7">You might have noticed this earlier if you ever looked deeper into this company.</text>
  <text id="day38_angela_8">But the pipe used to emit energy to the outside hasn't worked for a long time. It is now very rusty.</text>
  <text id="day38_angela_9">That means energy collected from this branch is excluded from the total energy collected by Lobotomy Corporation.</text>
  <text id="day38_angela_10">Isn't it fascinating?</text>
  <text id="day38_angela_11">Don't be too upset. I'm not saying that all the energy you collected was for nothing.</text>
  <text id="day38_angela_12">Also, there's one more thing for you to find out.</text>
  <text id="day38_angela_13">Where does all of this energy go?</text>
