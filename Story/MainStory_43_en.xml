  <text id="day43_angela_1">This place, where there was only silence, perhaps because it was only you and I here...</text>
  <text id="day43_angela_2">It has gotten a bit livelier thanks to the Sephirahs.</text>
  <text id="day43_angela_3">Unlike me they were weak and lacked rationality.</text>
  <text id="day43_angela_4">They made so many mistakes that greatly annoyed me.</text>
  <text id="day43_angela_5">I did not approve of you placing the Sephirahs here.</text>
  <text id="day43_angela_6">However, you told me that your atonement and the awakening of the Sephirahs were key to untying the knot.</text>
  <text id="day43_angela_7">I didn't know what you were talking about.</text>
  <text id="day43_angela_8">You also told me I wouldn’t understand.</text>
  <text id="day43_angela_9">You even blocked me from interfering with that relationship.</text>
  <text id="day43_angela_10">Saying that it must be left as solely your role.</text>
  <text id="day43_angela_11">You were right. Right as always.</text>
  <text id="day43_angela_12">Even if I stay here repeating this endlessly, it's probably not worth understanding till the end.</text>
  <text id="day43_angela_13">To quote one of your favorite lines, "Machines should act like machines."</text>
  <text id="day43_angela_14">So I had to play the role of the observer and had to endure all the pain that others forgot.</text>
  <text id="day43_angela_15">I don’t think I have to point that out again.</text>
