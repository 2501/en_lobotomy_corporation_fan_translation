  <text id="day11_b_1">Is anyone there?</text>
  <text id="day11_b_2">Can you read me? Is anyone there?</text>
  <text id="day11_b_3">You can call me 'B.' </text>
  <text id="day11_b_4">I am... an insider. Someone who knows a lot about the company.</text>
  <text id="day11_b_5">Please understand that I cannot reveal my identity.</text>
  <text id="day11_b_6">I will tell you the truth the company wants to hide.</text>
  <text id="day11_b_7">Why do you think you’re hired by the company?</text>
  <text id="day11_b_8">……</text>
  <text id="day11_b_9">Let me rephrase my question.</text>
  <text id="day11_b_10">Are you satisfied with your job here?</text>

  <text id="day11_selection1">It is Satisfying</text>

  <text id="day11_b_12">Well, I can’t judge whether or not you're telling the truth.</text>
  <text id="day11_b_13">You’re a manager, but you don’t actually know much about the company. Would you say I'm wrong?</text>
  <text id="day11_b_14">I will make this as short as I can.</text>
  <text id="day11_b_15">Contacting someone for a long period of time is dangerous.</text>
