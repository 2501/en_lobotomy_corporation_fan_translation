  <text id="day4_angela_1">Are you proud of what you do here?</text>
  <text id="day4_angela_2">If not, this news will change your mind.</text>
  <text id="day4_angela_3">After your arrival, the energy output has increased by 13%.</text>
  <text id="day4_angela_4">A 13% increase is... a record-breaking figure.</text>
  <text id="day4_angela_5">How do you feel?</text>
  <text id="day4_selection1">I am proud.</text>
  <text id="day4_selection2">Unsure.</text>
  <text id="day4_angela_1_1">Since you arrived, the company has been doing better.</text>
  <text id="day4_angela_1_2">That means you’re doing your job.</text>
  <text id="day4_angela_1_3">There will be only good news.</text>
  <text id="day4_angela_1_4">A machine doesn’t flatter easily.</text>
  <text id="day4_angela_1_5">It’s good to know you’re happy.</text>
  <text id="day4_angela_1_6">I remember your face when you first came here.</text>
  <text id="day4_angela_1_7">You were withdrawn,</text>
  <text id="day4_angela_1_8">face all grim,</text>
  <text id="day4_angela_1_9">and alerted at my presence.</text>
  <text id="day4_angela_1_10">It’s okay for you to be happy now.</text>
  <text id="day4_angela_2_1">Why is that?</text>
  <text id="day4_angela_2_2">Isn’t it normal to be happy in a situation like this?</text>
  <text id="day4_angela_2_3">For your information, I practically ran here.</text>
  <text id="day4_angela_2_4">Just to deliver this news to you.</text>
  <text id="day4_angela_2_5">It’s a figure of speech of course, but I never expected such a reaction.</text>
  <text id="day4_angela_2_6">It would be nice if you were a bit happier.</text>
  <text id="day4_angela_3_1">It's a special day today.</text>
  <text id="day4_angela_3_2">See the glass of champagne? Let us toast.</text>
  <text id="day4_angela_3_3">Oh, it’s not someone's birthday or the company's day of founding.</text>
  <text id="day4_angela_3_4">You lost an employee for the first time yesterday.</text>
  <text id="day4_angela_3_5">And many more will follow. I am here to help you cope with it.</text>
  <text id="day4_angela_3_6">They knew the risks from the beginning. The company grows on their sacrifices.</text>
  <text id="day4_angela_3_7">I’m sure they would feel proud of themselves in their dying breath.</text>
  <text id="day4_angela_3_8">You should respect them.</text>
  <text id="day4_angela_3_9">That is why we're toasting now.</text>
  <text id="day4_angela_3_10">Cheers for the deceased, to remember their noble sacrifices.</text>
  <text id="day4_selection3">Drink the champagne.</text>
  <text id="day4_selection4">Don’t drink it.</text>
  <text id="day4_angela_4_1">I will give you a tip.</text>
  <text id="day4_angela_4_2">To properly drink a glass of champagne, lightly hold the lower stem of the glass and savor the bubbles.</text>
  <text id="day4_angela_4_3">Yes, just like that.</text>
  <text id="day4_angela_5_1">Are you saving it for later?</text>
  <text id="day4_angela_5_2">Fine, there will be many occasions to toast on.</text>
  <text id="day4_angela_5_3">But manager, please refrain from drinking alone.</text>
  <text id="day4_angela_5_4">Celebrating alone is not good.</text>
