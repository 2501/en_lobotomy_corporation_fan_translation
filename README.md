# en_lobotomy_corporation_fan_translation
A US-English (en-US) fan translation of the game [Lobotomy Corporation](https://store.steampowered.com/app/568220/Lobotomy_Corporation__Monster_Management_Simulation/).

# Why?
Lobotomy Corporation is a pretty fantastic game, but it seems that they've unfortunately [run into some problems with the translators they hired](https://www.reddit.com/r/LobotomyCorp/comments/7t4jw3/hi_guys_id_like_to_talk_about_eng_translation/?st=jk1zk2dx&sh=151bccf1), and the quality of the English translation has suffered as a result. That incident is a shame on its own, but is amplified by the fact that it creates a higher barrier to entry to this otherwise pretty great game, so I created this repo to solve that problem.

# How do I use it?
This is more or less a direct (edited) copy-and-paste of the Unity XML translation files, so ideally you should be able to copy-and-paste the contents of this repository over the same files in your Windows Steam installation. No other platforms (if any?) are supported at this time.

In particular, this repo's contents should be copied to the following directory (or equivalent): `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\LobotomyCorp\LobotomyCorp_Data\ExternalData\xml`. Overwrite all affected files.

Note that this will create a mismatch with Steam's concept of what the file contents _should_ be, so you may wish to disable auto-updating in the game's steam properties after installing this fan translation.

# How do I help?
Thanks for asking! Please contact me to become a contributor and open a new branch to make the changes to your translated files (and other updated files, such as "translation_progess.md"). Additionally, please take a look at "translation_guidelines.md" so everyone can coordinate on details which reach across files and/or the entire game (The names of the types of work, Zayin/Teth/He/Waw/Aleph, etc.).

Once you're ready, make a Pull Request with your changes and we can collaborate to get your work into master.

Feel free to fork this repo as well if you wish to take things in a different direction.

NOTE: At this time I'm far from fluent in any language but English, so if you happen to know Korean your assistance would be especially well appreciated as you may have insight I lack.
