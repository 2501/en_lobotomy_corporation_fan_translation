It doesn’t belong here.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;- What’s your opinion on the nature of human, employee Serena?&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Employee Serena: ….I think it depends on the person’s experience. Why do you ask?&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;- It is highly debatable topic. But this is what we think we should do. If a person is good from the start, we protect their good heart. If a person is bad from the start, we will make a good heart out of them and protect it.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Employee Serena: How are you going to do it?&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;- We can see the color of heart. The color of human heart is pink. By wearing the same color, we can blend into the people’s mind. We will gladly get dirty for the good-hearted people.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Employee Serena: Wait, you will get dirty instead of people? Is that possible?&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;- It is.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Employee Serena: I’m sorry but I just can’t trust you. It’s awfully suspicious that you can see the color of people’s heart.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;- If anything happens, just call us, ma’am. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;(End of recording)&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;According to the recording, the abnormality’s will to help employees is solid.&#13;&#10;We have yet to grasp detailed information about this abnormality. Perhaps actually asking for help could help us get more info. However, just like any other abnormality, we cannot blindly trust it. I’m planning to have a fireteam ready while I pretend to request a help. }

And I’ve been using it since then. I got help about (Redacted) times. My efficiency at work has gotten much better. At this point, just looking at pink soothes my mind. Those creatures bolsters in a way that even a greatest leader can’t. This abnormality will greatly improve our employees’ quality of life.}

They’re much better than human soldiers. Please consider to officially designate them as the company’s fireteam.
