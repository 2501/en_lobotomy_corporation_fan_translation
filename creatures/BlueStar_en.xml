      {Urgent announcement to all personnel working in Lobotomy. We support any company program that promotes positivity. But recently, we’ve gotten reports that there have been group activities that are planning conspiracies. Due to the many allegations, so we decided to investigate.&#13;&#10;By company policy, you are not allowed to idolize and/or worship certain Abnormalities. It is not allowed to “idolize” any being here.&#13;&#10;Employees who are caught trying to enter a Containment Facility without authorization will be punished.&#13;&#10;If you have an impulse to throw yourself toward a certain Abnormality, that means you are under the influence of a certain "infection." Just like some Abnormalities that are held here, it's part of the process of controlling and misleading your brain. If this happens, please stop working and immediately seek mental treatment. As you have all passed basic employee training, I hope no one will be foolish enough to be misled.}

I heard that she repeatedly tried to escape, so they tied her to her bed.&#13;&#10;Tell me, is it wrong to have faith?&#13;&#10;We are all sinners, and the Blue Star is the only place that accepts sinners. We will purify our sins there.&#13;&#10;We all go back to that place someday. It's an instinct. You may think Emily, who threw herself into the Blue Star, is dead, but she only returned to her rightful place. She’s a martyr. She became an eternal star.&#13;&#10;The rising of a star means a brand new start. Don’t you hear the sound the everlasting trumpet?&#13;&#10;When you are close to the star you can hear the welcoming cheers and singing.&#13;&#10;If we all return back to this place, only the Blue Star will remain.&#13;&#10;We will meet again as stars.}
