  <text id="boss_kether_overload4_E1_3">You told Giovanni that you could revive Carmen. But, think about it. Did you really lead him to the eternal slumber because you believed so?</text>



  <text id="boss_kether_overload5_E1_0">The world has abandoned us! We tried not to let it go but it threw us like a piece of garbage at the end. </text>
  <text id="boss_kether_overload5_E1_1">I was too naïve. I realized what we have done after all these years. </text>
  <text id="boss_kether_overload5_E1_2">A brief struggle has become forever. I just wish that you don’t fall into despair and anger again.</text>
  <text id="boss_kether_overload5_E1_3">You can overcome this if you wake up. You still have a chance. Please, listen to me. </text>


  <text id="boss_kether_overload1_E2_0">Only regret is waiting for you tomorrow. A well-deserved punishment for us. </text>
  <text id="boss_kether_overload1_E2_1">We tried to don’t trust anyone. But we shamelessly woke up our comrades who fell asleep…</text>
  <text id="boss_kether_overload1_E2_2">Do not fear the sinking. Accept it. Let us sink with Carmen.</text>

  <text id="boss_kether_overload2_E2_0">Don’t have hope for anything. For our employees who died hopelessly, at least.</text>
  <text id="boss_kether_overload2_E2_1">If the existence itself is an ailment to us, there’s only one way to cure it. Just close your eyes, and never open them again.</text>
  <text id="boss_kether_overload2_E2_2">We broke everything with her warmth in our hands. </text>
  <text id="boss_kether_overload2_E2_3">Tell me, what great purpose did we have in those actions?</text>

  <text id="boss_kether_overload3_E2_0">You will never escape this guilt if you just stay that way. You will curse your existence, you everyday will be painful. </text>
  <text id="boss_kether_overload3_E2_1">Carmen has gone without a smile. As a nap under the warm sun will never return.</text>
  <text id="boss_kether_overload3_E2_2">You just have to let everything go. You don’t even have power to grab on anything….</text>
  <text id="boss_kether_overload3_E2_3">The things I let go has gone too far for me to take them in my hands again. </text>
  <text id="boss_kether_overload3_E2_4">Why do I have to be abandoned by this world alone like this?</text>

  <text id="boss_kether_overload4_E2_0">Yes, there was only path of despair in the sky she looked up to.</text>
  <text id="boss_kether_overload4_E2_1">Desires are void and meaningless. Can’t you hear it? The doors are closing. They will not open again.</text>
  <text id="boss_kether_overload4_E2_2">I’m fine with my life expiring here now. Only stigma waits for those who do not overcome. </text>
  <text id="boss_kether_overload4_E2_3">It was my job protecting my employees and friends. But I couldn’t save even one person.</text>

  <text id="boss_kether_overload5_E2_0">The scene, the air, the pain of that day…It comes back no matter how many times I try to erase them. Tell me, how do I get away from this?</text>
  <text id="boss_kether_overload5_E2_1">Do we really deserve to exist? Stepping on all those sacrifices? </text>
  <text id="boss_kether_overload5_E2_2">Let us just sleep peacefully… Let us sink and flow to the stream with Carmen, who must have been lonely for so long…</text>


  <text id="boss_kether_overload1_E3_0">The path I took was riddled with thorns with no ends in sight. </text>
  <text id="boss_kether_overload1_E3_1">Thus, I have revealed myself. I, who do not cling on to mere past, regrets, and memories. </text>
  <text id="boss_kether_overload1_E3_2">People live day by day looking up to the hope they cannot reach while shedding tears of pain. We have power to save them and we must rightfully use it.</text>
  <text id="boss_kether_overload1_E3_3">They will perish in torment if a redeemer does not save them as mankind was saved from the great flood long time ago because of the ark. </text>

  <text id="boss_kether_overload2_E3_0">We must use the power if we have it.</text>
  <text id="boss_kether_overload2_E3_1">You know how many sacrifices were made to come this far. We cannot let them in vain. Join me.</text>
  <text id="boss_kether_overload2_E3_2">We are all sinners. Our imperfect eyes could not see the world properly. It is time that I cleaned them. </text>

  <text id="boss_kether_overload3_E3_0">People are too ignorant to see what’s going on to the world they’re stepping on. However, ignorance is not a sin. Disbelief is. </text>
  <text id="boss_kether_overload3_E3_1">People had to give up on freedom and desires for life. But do you think they are truly gone? They were merely waiting for the chance to rise again.</text>
  <text id="boss_kether_overload3_E3_2">The desires humanity has given up are floating under the deep stream. People shall be isolated from themselves and never be free and if they stay this way.  </text>
  <text id="boss_kether_overload3_E3_3">They thirst for pure desires. We shall fill their glasses with forbidden fruits.  </text>

  <text id="boss_kether_overload4_E3_0">A person needs to be free to be human. </text>
  <text id="boss_kether_overload4_E3_1">The sky will fall, and people will be holy. They will search for the promised glory as they change.</text>
  <text id="boss_kether_overload4_E3_2">I know you are not sure what’s ahead of you. The future you want might never come. I can show the future in front of your eyes, instead.  </text>
  <text id="boss_kether_overload4_E3_3">Let go of your fear and gain true freedom. It will also cure the disease she tried to heal.</text>

  <text id="boss_kether_overload5_E3_0">You do not hear the trumpets.</text>
  <text id="boss_kether_overload5_E3_1">How shameful. Do you truly want to people to suffocate, locked in their skin?</text>
  <text id="boss_kether_overload5_E3_2">They are moaning in agony even as of this moment. Why can’t you hear them?</text>
  <text id="boss_kether_overload5_E3_3">One bite of this sweet fruit will redeem all of them!</text>

  <text id="boss_kether_default_E4_0">Let’s get to work. As we always have done.</text>

  <!--반전-->
  <text id="boss_kether_default_E4_1">You might feel a bit dizzy, but it’s worth it. Just bear with it.</text>
  <text id="boss_kether_default_E4_2">I hope no one dies or suffer today.</text>
  <text id="boss_kether_default_E4_3">I’m so sorry that I have to make you do this again. But you’re not far from the end.</text>
  <text id="boss_kether_default_E4_4">You have been through so much. Today came before you realized as you have endured the pain.</text>
  <text id="boss_kether_default_E4_5">You made it this far. I know you will make it again. Let us face this day just like the other ones.</text>

  <!--상승-->
  <text id="boss_kether_default_E4_6">It has been so long since I saw the light behind the mist. </text>
  <text id="boss_kether_default_E4_7">We were buried here for an immeasurable time. </text>


  <!--지상-->
  <text id="boss_kether_default_E4_8">I haven’t been outside for ages. It seems nothing has changed much. The same glorious, mundane scenery.</text>
  <text id="boss_kether_default_E4_9">Let’s embrace this place with warmth. So everyone can shine like the stars in the sky.</text>
  <text id="boss_kether_default_E4_10">We will make human be human. What’s left for us after that is just to watch.</text>

  <!--기둥-->
  <text id="boss_kether_default_E4_11">The energy you produced for the last 50 days is for this day. The moment we shine down the world.</text>
  <text id="boss_kether_default_E4_12">Let’s give them the answer we searched for eons. </text>
  <text id="boss_kether_default_E4_13">It is time for us to step down from the stage. We won’t be forgotten even if we scatter and fade into the light.</text>
