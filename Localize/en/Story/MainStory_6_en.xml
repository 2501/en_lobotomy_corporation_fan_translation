  <text id="day6_angela_1">As you know, a lot of employees are working for the company.</text>
  <text id="day6_angela_2">A majority of them want to know more about you.</text>
  <text id="day6_angela_3">Some will show initiative and approach you first.</text>
  <text id="day6_angela_4">It’s funny, knowing who you are in person doesn't improve the odds.</text>
  <text id="day6_angela_5">There are no regulations that prevent you from interacting with them in person.</text>
  <text id="day6_angela_6">It seems the one who made those rules didn’t consider situations like this.</text>
  <text id="day6_angela_7">It is a good opportunity for you to show that you care.</text>
  <text id="day6_angela_8">Words travel faster than you think.</text>
  <text id="day6_angela_9">I'm not going to stop someone from meeting you.</text>
  <text id="day6_angela_10">But you don't have to do everything they want.</text>
  <text id="day6_angela_11">Just thank them for their effort.</text>
  <text id="day6_angela_12">And tell them you hope they'll keep up the good work.</text>
  <text id="day6_angela_13">That’s a win-win, don’t you think?</text>
  <text id="day6_angela_14">Do you follow? What they- WE - need is a gesture of good will, and nothing more. Don't go overboard.</text>
  <text id="day6_angela_15">Give them a vending machine and next they will demand a bar.</text>
  <text id="day6_angela_16">I expect you to make the right decision.</text>
