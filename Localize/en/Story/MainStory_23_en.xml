  <text id="day23_angela_2">But what does fertile mean to them? </text>
  <text id="day23_angela_3">Is it worthy of all the conflict and pain?</text>

  <text id="day23_angela_6">Looking at them, some saw despair, while others saw hope.</text>
  <text id="day23_angela_7">At a certain moment, a new civilization was born.</text>
  <text id="day23_angela_8">Many changes were made with unbelievable speed. </text>
  <text id="day23_angela_9">Along with new technologies being discovered.</text>
  <text id="day23_angela_10">All of the Wings hold at least one Singularity.</text>
