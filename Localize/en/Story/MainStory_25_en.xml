  <text id="day25_angela_1">The human mind is a melting pot of feelings.</text>
  <text id="day25_angela_2">Memories, obsessions, wishes, agonies, and feelings of happiness and sadness.</text>
  <text id="day25_angela_3">Stronger emotions also means stronger energy.</text>
  <text id="day25_angela_4">The combined effort of numerous people brought Lobotomy Corporation to where it is now.</text>
  <text id="day25_angela_5">We had to keep on with various experiments.</text>
  <text id="day25_angela_6">Just like how we hire new employees now, we recruited lots of people for the experiments.</text>
  <text id="day25_angela_7">There was not a definite shape at first.</text>
  <text id="day25_angela_8">Then it slowly assumed a form.</text>
  <text id="day25_angela_9">Finally, A understood while studying the changes...</text>
  <text id="day25_angela_10">Their abilities, where they lived, their jobs, and their strengths are not important.</text>
  <text id="day25_angela_11">What was required was a massive amount of energy.</text>
  <text id="day25_angela_12">This meant we didn’t have to pay attention.</text>
  <text id="day25_angela_13">Negative thoughts...</text>
  <text id="day25_angela_14">Always floating in the back of your head.</text>
  <text id="day25_angela_15">Rotting and twisting your mind until you are left with nothing but self loathing.</text>
  <text id="day25_angela_16">Come to think of it, I haven’t properly asked for your opinion.</text>
  <text id="day25_angela_17">Do you truly wish to meet A?</text>
  <text id="day25_selection1">Yes.</text>
  <text id="day25_selection2">No.</text>
  <text id="day25_angela_1_1">All right.</text>
  <text id="day25_angela_1_2">I will tell A your thoughts when he returns.</text>
  <text id="day25_angela_1_3">But don’t expect him to give you a warm greeting.</text>
  <text id="day25_angela_1_4">'A' is a person who conceals his mind.</text>
  <text id="day25_angela_1_5">Perhaps even more than I do.</text>
  <text id="day25_angela_2_1">He may think now is not the time.</text>
  <text id="day25_angela_2_2">Actually, I’m not sure if I want to meet him when he returns either.</text>
  <text id="day25_angela_2_3">What I’ve just said is a secret to A, of course.</text>
  <text id="day25_angela_2_4">When his long journey ends and he returns...</text>
  <text id="day25_angela_2_5">I should go at least and greet him, don’t you think?</text>
