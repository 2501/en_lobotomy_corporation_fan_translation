  <text id="day10_angela_1">Manager? What seems to be wrong?</text>
  <text id="day10_angela_2">Ah, I see.</text>
  <text id="day10_angela_3">Will you wait just a moment? If you can’t bear to look, you should close your eyes.</text>
  <text id="day10_angela_4">There, I fixed it. There was a system error, however, it shouldn’t be so easily compromised.</text>
  <text id="day10_angela_5">It's a technology originally developed during the war, now widely used for commercial purposes.</text>
  <text id="day10_angela_6">Honestly, it's not that impressive of a technology.</text>
  <text id="day10_angela_7">The human brain is fragile. Seeing such a cruel and shocking sight may unintentionally lead to a momentary 'shut down' of the brain's functions.</text>
  <text id="day10_angela_8">If a manager like you were to suffer such a reaction, it would be very difficult for me.</text>
  <text id="day10_angela_9">So I installed a perception filter in your display.</text>
  <text id="day10_angela_10">While the perception filter functions, dead employees will look like cute dolls splattered with red paint.</text>
  <text id="day10_angela_11">Abnormalities, well, those who could damage your mental state. They will be seen as adorable toys.</text>
  <text id="day10_angela_12">Trust me, before the perception filter was installed, lots of managers lost their sanity on that seat.</text>
  <text id="day10_angela_13">I can’t let you join them.</text>
