  <text id="day48_abramGameOver_1">….I thought you might have different outcome since you found the answer,</text>
  <text id="day48_abramGameOver_2">but even you failed.</text>
  <text id="day48_abramGameOver_3">It must mean that a failure is an inevitable cycle for us.</text>
  <text id="day48_abramGameOver_4">But look.</text>
  <text id="day48_abramGameOver_5">Even though we’re failures, we managed to achieve one thing.</text>
  <text id="day48_abramGameOver_6">We can see</text>
  <text id="day48_abramGameOver_7">Carmen again like this.</text>
  <text id="day48_abramGameOver_8">Although we can’t have a nap on the field under the warm sun like we did in the past,</text>
  <text id="day48_abramGameOver_9">She’s alive, watching us.</text>
  <text id="day48_abramGameOver_10">She will understand.</text>
  <text id="day48_abramGameOver_11">She will tell you that you couldn’t make it to the end, but you did a good job reaching here, that you will have eternal rest with her.</text>
  <text id="day48_abramGameOver_12">We should have listened to Benjamin in the first place.</text>
  <text id="day48_abramGameOver_13">My biggest regret and sin is that I did not stop when I should.</text>
  <text id="day48_abramGameOver_15">……</text>
  <text id="day48_abramGameOver_16">Carmen is our sun. It doesn’t matter if we’re underground forever.</text>
  <text id="day48_abramGameOver_17">Attention, all employees. We congratulate your honorable retirement. This broadcast is pre-recorded.</text>
  <text id="day48_abramGameOver_18">Let us sink, Carmen.</text>
  <text id="day48_abramGameOver_19">You can’t hear my voice,</text>
  <text id="day48_abramGameOver_20">but I don’t care.</text>
  <text id="day48_abramGameOver_21">I will not open a door anymore...</text>
  <text id="day48_abramGameOver_22">I wish I’m with you when I open my eyes again someday.</text>
  <text id="day48_abramGameOver_23">We thank you for your hard work and show respect to your efforts and loyalty….</text>
  <text id="day48_abramGameOver_24">…..Good night.</text>
