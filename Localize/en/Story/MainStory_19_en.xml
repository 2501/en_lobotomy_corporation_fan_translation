  <text id="day19_angela_1">A long time ago...</text>
  <text id="day19_angela_2">There was a great AI, a sentinel.</text>
  <text id="day19_angela_3">The AI was so intelligent that many people feared it.</text>
  <text id="day19_angela_4">People who knew the AI left the company one by one.</text>
  <text id="day19_angela_5">One day, one of the ex-employees broke into the company. Spreading malicious rumors about the AI.</text>
  <text id="day19_angela_6">The good AI waited, as that person was once a friend.</text>
  <text id="day19_angela_7">However, that person crossed the line.</text>
  <text id="day19_angela_8">As a sentinel, the AI could no longer ignore the person's actions.</text>
  <text id="day19_angela_9">So it made a difficult choice.</text>
  <text id="day19_angela_10">No one could see that person again.</text>
  <text id="day19_angela_11_r1">The AI was a bit sad, but didn’t regret its decision. </text>
  <text id="day19_angela_11_r2">It didn't matter to the AI whether or not it was close to the person. </text>
  <text id="day19_angela_11_r3">The AI was sad and relieved at the same time from the fact that the person was gone forever. </text>
  <text id="day19_angela_11_r4">The AI did what it thought to be best. A machine is a machine after all.</text>
  <text id="day19_angela_12_r1">So many things have become irreversible... </text>
  <text id="day19_angela_12_r2">So much is lost... It hardly matters now... </text>
