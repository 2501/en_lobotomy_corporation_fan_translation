  <text id="day30_carmen_1">Ah, in this place... the sunlight is truly warm.</text>
  <text id="day30_carmen_2">Perhaps I was a tree in a past life.</text>
   <!-- Asking NEET about lines 3-5 -->
  <text id="day30_carmen_3">Hmm... Think of a former life as the life my soul lived before being born into the current form you see now.</text>
  <text id="day30_carmen_4">Isn't this fun to think about? Ahaha.</text>
  <text id="day30_carmen_5">My next life?</text>
  <text id="day30_carmen_6">I would want to be a person with a beautiful voice.</text>
  <text id="day30_carmen_7">Then everyone would pay more attention to what I say.</text>
  <text id="day30_carmen_8">Maybe that’s too much to ask? Especially with all my abilities, haha.</text>
  <text id="day30_carmen_9">What about you? Who or what do you want to become?</text>
  <text id="day30_a_1">….. …… …….</text>
  <text id="day30_carmen_10">What kind of thought is that? Hahaha.</text>
  <text id="day30_carmen_11">Look at this, a medicine extracted from the human subconsciousness.</text>
  <text id="day30_carmen_12">A form made from a formless concept, isn’t it interesting?</text>
  <text id="day30_carmen_13">This will become a seed of sorts.</text>
  <text id="day30_carmen_14">Since an incurable disease has been discovered it would only be fair to discover the cure for it, don’t you think?</text>
