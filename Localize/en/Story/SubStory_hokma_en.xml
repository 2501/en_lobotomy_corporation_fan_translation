  <text id="hokma1_intro_h1">Welcome, A.</text>
  <text id="hokma1_intro_h2">I missed you.</text>
  <text id="hokma1_intro_h3">I have been waiting for you ever since the very first day I've started working here.</text>
  <text id="hokma1_intro_h4">Do you remember the ocean?</text>
  <text id="hokma1_intro_h5">You said this place is where everything from all the rivers and streams will eventually settle. As such...</text>
  <text id="hokma1_intro_h6">in the under layers, everything sinks.</text>
  <text id="hokma1_intro_h7">What do you think of the heaven painted laboriously white with plaster?</text>
  <text id="hokma1_intro_h8">I knew you would come soon.</text>
  <text id="hokma1_intro_h9">Please think of it as my welcoming gift for you.</text>
  <text id="hokma1_intro_h10">I thought that what you missed might be a different scene other than me right now.</text>
  <text id="hokma1_intro_h11">Time is like a sword, it attempts to cut and divide the clasped hands of those you love.</text>
  <text id="hokma1_intro_h12">Everyone I loved is now gone, leaving me, an old man, behind.</text>
  <text id="hokma1_intro_h13">Don’t blame yourself.</text>
  <text id="hokma1_intro_h14">That time was the brightest moment in my life.</text>
  <text id="hokma1_intro_h15">The one thing I regret is that I was too scared and I ran away without keeping my promise to you until the very end.</text>
  <text id="hokma1_intro_h16">But eventually, you found me, helping me keep my promise here. How can I be more thankful than I'm right now?</text>
  <text id="hokma1_intro_h17">You are just too kind to me, even to the very end.</text>

  <text id="hokma2_intro_h1">Are we getting close to our goal?</text>
  <text id="hokma2_intro_h2">Just like people said, aging doesn't necessarily mean greater wisdom.</text>
  <text id="hokma2_intro_h3">Judging from how obsessing over irregular greed and those that have passed has created a repeating the cycle of regret that has led to the daily routine of looking at the clock for no reason.</text>
  <text id="hokma2_intro_h4">I always wanted to ask you something.</text>
  <text id="hokma2_intro_h5">I saw your sad expression whenever one of your employees died.</text>
  <text id="hokma2_intro_h6">Just like how I became an old man, no human being is free from the cycle of life and death.</text>
  <text id="hokma2_intro_h7">Like what we researched was to cure the disease, not to live forever.</text>
  <text id="hokma2_intro_h8">How about an example?</text>
  <text id="hokma2_intro_h9">Remember that employee, who was really nice to you?</text>
  <text id="hokma2_intro_h10">He died recently.</text>
  <text id="hokma2_intro_h11">When I received the letter of him entering Lobotomy, I wasn't expecting him to die such a futile death.</text>
  <text id="hokma2_intro_h12">If I wanted, I could have brought him back to you.</text>
  <text id="hokma2_intro_h13">But I didn’t. It is the order of this place that an empty spot shall be filled.</text>
  <text id="hokma2_intro_h14">Do you know the secret of this place?</text>
  <text id="hokma2_intro_h15">Lives are too trivial here, they leave or come back too easily. It's to the point that we don’t even need to mourn their deaths.</text>
  <text id="hokma2_intro_h16">An employee who died yesterday may come back from my simple call or with a flick of my hand, another employee may never be able to open their eyes again.</text>
  <text id="hokma2_intro_h17">That’s death here, A.</text>
  <text id="hokma2_intro_h18">It’s neither honorable nor noble; neither is it miserable nor cruel as we think it to be.</text>
  <text id="hokma2_intro_h19">So please don’t punish yourself too much.</text>
  <text id="hokma2_intro_h20">I don’t want you to suffer from all these trivial things.</text>
  <text id="hokma2_intro_h21">You will have much more pain to bear in the future anyway.</text>

  <text id="hokma3_intro_h1">You may think,</text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h2">that I do not know anything about what is going on up there.</text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h3">But it’s you who don’t know.</text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h4">Pain, agony, regrets, and the shadows of the past that will never let you go.</text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h5">They’ve spent quite a lot of days with you, but it’s nothing compared to our time together.</text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h6">They didn’t know you.</text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h7">Those who could not accept their fate, seem to be up in arms about you,</text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h8">like that person who broke himself whenever he’s ordered to execute “redaction”.</text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h9">Unnecessary expression of emotions is unfavorable. </text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h10">I need to show you, to let you know it. </text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h11">There was an employee named Anya who had her parents and a little sister.</text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h12">She wanted to study, but her family’s financial state didn’t allow her.</text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h13">She tried to join other Wings, but she was not good enough for them.</text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h14">In such hard times, she received a mail from one of the Wings, Lobotomy Corp.</text>
    <text id="hokma3_intro_letter">Dear Ms.Anya</text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h15">A letter with a very simple yet magical line that says,</text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h16"> “You are qualified to join Lobotomy Corporation”.</text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h17">Awestruck, Anya read down the letter over and over again.</text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h18">It didn’t seem like someone was pulling a prank or the mail courier’s mistake. </text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h19">At that instant, she realized that she never applied for Lobotomy Corporation.</text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h20">But soon, she shook that thought off. It wasn’t important.</text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h21">I was the courier. I delivered those letters to people.</text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h22">I grant their wish after evaluating them.</text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h23">Anya didn't selected because of the excellent skill.</text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h23_1">She had a common trait that every employee doesn’t realize but has.</text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h24">As you know, to become a feather, a part of a Wing, you need to be immensely better than ordinary people.</text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h25">How could Anya, who couldn’t graduate from school, had no skill, and were living in a backstreet outside the nest, join our company?</text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h26">Could her family finally find happiness?</text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h27">All this happened 10 years ago.</text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h28">During that time, her sister died from a disease and her parents passed away.</text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h29">Where’s Anya now, without her family?</text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h30">She is asleep, down here.</text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h31">It means that you can wake her up.</text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h32">It’s within my scope of authority to do so, but I’ll grant you access for this time. </text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h33">Wake her up, please.</text>
  <text id="hokma3_selection1">Load</text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h34">Now Anya is at work, feeling like a fresh employee who just joined the company, </text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h35">Completely oblivious to the fact that it’s been 10 years since she actually joined us.</text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h36">Now, erase her, please.</text>
  <text id="hokma3_selection2">Erase</text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h37">How do you feel?</text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h38">Anya who was killed by a monster and Anya who you just erased are the same. They all evanescently lost their lives.</text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h39">It is such a futile action…to wake them up and erase them, again and again.</text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h40">Your, or Sepirahs’, attachment to the employees is meaningless here.</text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h41">Everything alive in this facility is paused.</text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h42">They wait for the morning with their eyes closed every night.</text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h43">The ones up there didn’t know that. They were emotionally spending to the deaths in front of them.</text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h44">They crumbled, they pointed their obscure anger to the ones like you. </text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h45">Do not worry, I will not do that.</text>
  <text id="hokma3_intro_h46">I have always wanted to be an important part of your life.</text>

  <!-- 에피소드 4-->

  <text id="hokma4_intro_a1">I finished assigning upper and middle level Sepirahs.</text>
  <text id="hokma4_intro_a2">This won’t be the last time I do this.</text>
  <text id="hokma4_intro_a3">I will probably have to tell them what I’ve already told countless times. But you’ll be different.</text>
  <text id="hokma4_intro_a4">You know why this facility exists and your missions,</text>
  <text id="hokma4_intro_a5">I hope you don’t exhaust me like them.</text>
  <text id="hokma4_intro_a6">Just keep this in mind.</text>
  <text id="hokma4_intro_a7">I will not come down here unless the circumstances require me.</text>
  <text id="hokma4_intro_a8">That doesn’t mean that I will just watch and do nothing, but I will not interfere for the most time.</text>
  <text id="hokma4_intro_a9">….….</text>
  <text id="hokma4_intro_a10">I hope we don’t see each other often from now on.</text>
  <text id="hokma4_intro_a11">It would only hurt us.</text>
  <text id="hokma4_intro_h1">Angela was the best AI that I had ever known.</text>
  <text id="hokma4_intro_h2">You are the best architect that I’ve ever known.</text>
  <text id="hokma4_intro_h3">You already know Carmen’s body is nothing but a shell,</text>
  <text id="hokma4_intro_h4">but you couldn’t forget her. You tried to keep her by locking her in a cryostasis pod.</text>
  <text id="hokma4_intro_h5">With grieving face, you ransacked her body and detached her core. </text>
  <text id="hokma4_intro_h6">I was actually relived when I realized that you were making Angela.</text>
  <text id="hokma4_intro_h7">You were focusing on something, just like you did before. </text>
  <text id="hokma4_intro_h8">……</text>
  <text id="hokma4_intro_h9">That day when she opened her eyes.</text>
  <text id="hokma4_intro_h10">I remember that you were just staring into the laboratory’s windows, not setting a foot inside.</text>
  <text id="hokma4_intro_h11">You might have thought that you saw me right away,</text>
  <text id="hokma4_intro_h12">but I was looking at you for a long time before you realized.</text>
  <text id="hokma4_intro_h13">Why did you hesitate?</text>
  <text id="hokma4_intro_h14">What did you think after seeing Angela, who can’t show any signs of affection towards you, unlike Carmen?</text>
  <text id="hokma4_intro_h15">I told you countless times that you can make a hundred of AIs, but they will never be Carmen.</text>
  <text id="hokma4_intro_h16">Now poor Angela is merely assigned to look after us.</text>
  <text id="hokma4_intro_h17">If there’s something I have mistaken,</text>
  <text id="hokma4_intro_h18">It is that I thought you’ve overcome everything,</text>
  <text id="hokma4_intro_h19">but the truth was that you never have.</text>

  <text id="hokma5_intro_m1">I will try my best!</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_y1">I advise you not to be so lazy.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_hod1">Is it okay if I do this?</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_c1">Don’t worry, you don’t find a veteran like me often.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_ca1">..............</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_a1">.....</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_a2">Hello, A.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h1">The moments I just showed you are not merely a past.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h2">It could be the present, even the future.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h3">There are people who loved you once, and employees thinking they’re happy here.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h4">There’s also Angela, who is an imitation of Carmen.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h5">Isn’t this the heaven that you have been yearning for?</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h6">You are a god here. Even death is meaningless in this place.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h7">So, why don’t you just be satisfied already?</text>

  <text id="hokma5_intro_h8">We are desperately existing, even if it means living like this.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h9">What rights do you have to turn everything into ashes?</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h10">Also,</text>

  <text id="hokma5_intro_h11">This story does not need an end.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h12">Think about it.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h13">All the works that you’ve done, are they really the consequences of your choices?</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h14">You were never ready.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h15">You couldn’t accept her death, so you created the being filled with loss.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h16">Now you’re just blindly struggling to find the obscure trails of your actions.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h17">What’s worse is that you were never serious doing those.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h18">So, go back, now.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_selection1">Do not go back</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h19">Look at you, you are proving me.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h20">You are not serious even in the choices you make.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h21">You’ll probably return to me after making a new start, if you went back.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h22">But that is also uncontrollable, since this whole place has become a giant clockwork.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h23">A clock never stops.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h24">It doesn’t rest. It doesn’t rush. It isn’t set to specific someone.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h25">It just walks forever with the same pace as always.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h26">Now, it is time for you to leave.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_selection2">Do not leave</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h27">You are a traveler without a compass.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h28">It is natural to feel fear in that situation.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h29">But you don’t have to fear the ticking clock.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h30">I will always welcome you, console you.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h31">You have never been ready.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_selection3">Do not go back</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h32">......</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h33">You didn’t change your decision.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h34">It seemed that tomorrow will come as it has always been, but it didn’t.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h35"> It’s been a long time since the time of silent waiting is over.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h36">When I no longer feared the impending night, I decided to love this place.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h37">but if you decided to break the egg at all costs,</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h38">I will become your sentinel, and I will be at your side.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h39">How can this be following her will?</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h40">This…this is nothing but a seed of calamity.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h41">By the wings! Your mind was soaked in grief, more severely than I thought.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h42">Just, just stop now.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h43">You, and we tried our best.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h44">With your career and wealth, you’ll be able to stay in the nest with no problem.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h45">Please, stop here.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_h46">Before you cross the line…</text>
  <text id="hokma5_selection4">Do not stop</text>
  <text id="hokma5_selection5">Do not stop</text>
  <text id="hokma5_selection6">Do not stop</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_A1">No one is left by my side.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_A2">With everyone’s sacrifice, I have reached the Wing, but I have no one left to celebrate with.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_A3">This silence was the start of my work.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_A4">We lost something in us, every day.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_A5">We inhumanly extracted information from the woman we captured at the head,</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_A6">passed out plans with nameless AIs.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_A7">It ripped the heart of the man who was always with me.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_A8">The sounds of waves were far and there was no staying.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_A9">I lost the last man who stood by me.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_A10">It was a tragedy, but I didn’t hide it.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_A11">The ones who left early probably didn’t need me, but I needed them at the last moments.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_A12">Bring back the ones who left the embrace of the earth. Hide and lock the seed of secret.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_A13">I was the only one left.</text>
  <text id="hokma5_intro_A14">I wanted to be forgotten like a mirage.</text>
