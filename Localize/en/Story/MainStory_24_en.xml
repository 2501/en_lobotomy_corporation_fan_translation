  <text id="day24_angela_1">Do you know there’s a cactus on your chaotic desk?</text>
  <text id="day24_angela_2">It looks like an employee who likes you put it there.</text>
  <text id="day24_angela_3">I don’t like cacti much.</text>
  <text id="day24_angela_4">There could be various reasons for growing a plant.</text>
  <text id="day24_angela_5">Although, the vicious thorns are not pleasing to look at, and it doesn’t produce valuable sap either.</text>
  <text id="day24_angela_6">I’ve also never seen it grow a flower bud. </text>
  <text id="day24_angela_7">Theoretically, it would bloom in the right environment.</text>
  <text id="day24_angela_8">Could it be that it thinks the area is barren, since I’ve never seen it. </text>
  <text id="day24_angela_9">Do you think the cactus bear a flower?</text>
  <text id="day24_selection1">Yes, it will.</text>
  <text id="day24_selection2">No, it won't.</text>
  <text id="day24_angela_1_1">You talk as if you've seen it for yourself.</text>
  <text id="day24_angela_1_2">Well, if you’re so sure about it then keep it.</text>
  <text id="day24_angela_1_3">This place doesn’t even have sunlight.</text>
  <text id="day24_angela_2_1">Why do you still keep it on your desk then?</text>
  <text id="day24_angela_2_2">Do you think it's rude to get rid of something you received as a gift?</text>
  <text id="day24_angela_2_3">Be careful, it could sting you when you reach for other things.</text>
