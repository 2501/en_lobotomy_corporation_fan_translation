	<text id="Rabbit_Captain_Start_2">Hoppety hop~ It's time to graze the fresh grass.</text>
	<text id="Rabbit_Captain_Start_Geburah">Let all the rabbits have their ears scratched. There's that Red Mist over there.</text>
  <text id="Rabbit_Captain_Start_Binah">She’s not really an arbiter, is she? If she is, keep in mind that this is not what the contract said.</text>
  <text id="Rabbit_Captain_Half_0">Half the Rabbit returned to the grassland.</text>
	<text id="Rabbit_Captain_Half_1">Half of Rabbit is wiped out. The monsters  of this place are pretty fucking too.</text>
	<text id="Rabbit_Captain_Half_2">Well, half  of Rabbit was ready to die. It's like the mission of exploring Suburb or clearing the Ruins.</text>
	<text id="Rabbit_Captain_Half_Geburah">Rabbit half wiped out. Are you still pretty?</text>
  <text id="Rabbit_Captain_Half_Binah">So, she really is not the real arbiter. Still, I see her using some singularities.</text>
  <text id="Rabbit_Captain_Almost_0">80% out of order. The  task of the Outer Area is better suited than the mission here.</text>
	<text id="Rabbit_Captain_Almost_1">80% of rabbits lag behind. Some crazy man thought to keep these monsters in the city, not beyond the Suburb.</text>
	<text id="Rabbit_Captain_Almost_Geburah">80% out of order. It's real hard. That's a monster. But it's not as good as it used to be.</text>
  <text id="Rabbit_Captain_Almost_Binah">Fairy and Key……such annoying powers, even though they’re weakened. </text>
  <text id="Rabbit_Captain_Eliminated_0">All Rabbits are wiped out. Well, good Luck.</text>

	<text id="Rabbit_Captain_Eliminated_2">It's all dead. We'd better go explore the Suburb or Ruin just to take this place.</text>
	<text id="Rabbit_Captain_Eliminated_Geburah">Red Mist... I'll tear you off one day ...</text>
  <text id="Rabbit_Captain_Eliminated_Binah">They must have known this would happen. We’re pulling out.</text>
  <text id="Rabbit_Captain_End_0">It was a satisfying meal.</text>
	<text id="Rabbit_Captain_End_1">Call me next time. We just need a paste.</text>
	<text id="Rabbit_Captain_End_2">I just wanted to participate if it was the situation.</text>
	<text id="Rabbit_Captain_End_3">Complete the mission. We forget everything we have been here.</text>
	<text id="Rabbit_Captain_End_Geburah">Thanks to that strange body, your strength is stronger than before, but I can not see any old skill.</text>

	<text id="Rabbit_Unit_Encounter_Creature_ALEPH_2">I don't think this can be solved by Rabbits alone.</text>
	<text id="Rabbit_Unit_Encounter_Creature_ALEPH_3">It is a crazy idea to use beings beyond the Suburbs.</text>
	<text id="Rabbit_Unit_Encounter_Creature_ALEPH_4">I knew this thing was in the depths of the Ruins.</text>
	<text id="Rabbit_Unit_Panic_0">Maximum of mental pollution. Conduct automatic disposal.</text>
	<text id="Rabbit_Unit_Panic_1">Automatic disposal eliminates risk.</text>
